	4. If a neutral litmus solution is added to sodium acetate solution, what will you observe and why?
<div>Ans. When neutral litmus solution is added to sodium acetate solution, it will turn blue because sodium acetate on anionic hydrolysis gives sodium hydroxide (strong base) and acetic acid (weak acid). Therefore, the resulting solution becomes basic in nature. </div>
